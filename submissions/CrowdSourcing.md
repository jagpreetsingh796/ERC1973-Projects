# Project Name: Crowdsourcing

# Authors and Github username: Jagpreet Singh (jagpreetsingh796)

# Description of the Project 
Crowdsourcing is a sourcing model in which individuals or organizations obtain goods and services, including ideas and finances, from a large, relatively open and often rapidly-evolving group of internet users; it divides work between participants to achieve a cumulative result.


# Problem specification related to ERC 1973

Participating users in the  network need to be incentivized when contributing good and services. When the nodes in the network reach a higher limit (100s, 1000s), reward distribution which may be in the form of an ICO faces a bottleneck due to block gas limit.  

# Solution in relation to ERC 1973 

Sound application of ERC 1973 allows reward distribution in a scalable manner to all the partcipating nodes.
