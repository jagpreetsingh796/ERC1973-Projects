# Project Name: Crowdsourcing

# Authors and Github username: Jagpreet Singh (jagpreetsingh796)

# Description of the Project 
Crowdsourcing is a sourcing model in which individuals or organizations obtain goods and services, including ideas and finances, from a large, relatively open and often rapidly-evolving group of internet users; it divides work between participants to achieve a cumulative result.


# Problem specification related to ERC 1973

Participating users in the  network need to be incentivized for there contribution .As the number of donors increases the push request can become an infeasible solution as the gas limit becomes the bottleneck.We can use the milestones as a form of trigger point
in our system for reward distribution.

# Solution in relation to ERC 1973 

The ERC 1973 takes care of the reward distribution by performing  pull request and helps us to scale better
